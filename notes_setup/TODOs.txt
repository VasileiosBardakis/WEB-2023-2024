Paradoxes:
Offer gia 1 item, kai de kanei reference to announcement.

Announcements are independent to offers. Offers can be generated endlessly, but announcements can be deleted without impacting them.

For manage requests of civilian:
PERSON requests ITEM for # PEOPLE and ITS STATUS
List of requests (xhr), on click display details (type=completed,not completed etc)

Use css display instead of innerhtml rewrites (computationally expensive)

TODO: 
Fix sql auth (where username = ?)
When scrolling, div goes inside sidebar
Going back a page breaks user flow (e.g. admin login -> backwards -> press register) (Πρέπει να κάνεις logout για να μπορείς να πάς στο Login page κανονικά, doesn't seem like a problem to me)
post/gets are checked twice: Once client-side to show proper errors or successes
and once more server side to check for good request and sql injections

HAVE TO THINK ABOUT FOREIGN KEYS (DELETING IS TORTURE)

Mobile and desktop compatibility:
If media > 700px, make everything stack vertically
On mobile make sidebar scale with canvas size and make canvas scrollable (tables)

For mapping (status codes, item id's) do DISTINCT query val -> map


Finishing touches:
Register: To column scalearei me to megalutero item, kanta aneksartita

Use # instead of . for unique elements

On table load: make each row appear with fade (end goal)

Handle SQL errors (e.g. when admin change db a user might be trying to access item that no longer exists) with sending response
On server error, close connection instead of closing server

Bad input for make request
